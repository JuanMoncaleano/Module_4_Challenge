School Performance Analysis with Pandas: My Contribution

--Project Overview--

This GitHub repository showcases my work in performing an in-depth analysis of standardized test scores within a school district. Leveraging the power of Pandas DataFrames and Jupyter Notebook, the project aims to assist local governance in making informed decisions on school budgets and educational strategies.

--**What I Did**--

As the lead data analyst on this project, I carried out the following tasks:

--**Data Collection and Preparation**--

Imported data from two separate CSV files containing rich datasets on student performance and school statistics.

Merged these datasets to create a unified DataFrame, allowing for more comprehensive analysis.

--Data Analysis--

Employed Pandas' groupby and various aggregate functions to generate insightful summary tables.

Designed the code to be modular and reusable so that it can be easily adapted for different school districts with similarly formatted data.

--Data Formatting--

Utilized .map formatting techniques to round off decimal numbers, enhancing the readability of the output.

Created two versions of the summary DataFrames: one formatted for immediate presentation and another left unformatted for subsequent analytical tasks.

--Key Insights and Trends--

Composed a detailed summary analysis that highlights key findings and observations that could be of interest to the mayor and the school board.
